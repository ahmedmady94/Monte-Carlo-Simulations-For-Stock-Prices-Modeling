# Monte-Carlo-Simulations-For-Stock-Prices-Modeling

The world of finanace constantly exhibits uncertainty, this uncertainty accounts for high level of randomness that makes our dependence on a certain experiment outcome seems to be naive approach in understanding what's happenning behind the scenes and intuitively what's the real outcome range should be. Monte Carlo is a very simple approach though a pretty significant one that allows us to get a better intuition of the development of stock shares over time interval.
